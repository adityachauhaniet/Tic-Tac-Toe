#  Tic Tac Toe with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning

Project Description: This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using Python, leveraging machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to create an intelligent agent capable of playing optimally. The agent is trained using Q-learning, allowing it to learn from its experiences and improve its gameplay over time. The project includes a user-friendly interface for human players to compete against the AI, along with visualizations of the training process and performance metrics. Explore the code to understand the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms and their application in game strategy development.
This game has two agent and 3x3 matrix table, one agent perform action with filling the box with 'X' and the ather agent perform action with filling the box with '0', if any one of the sequence comes thrice adjacently then that agent will be winner and game over.
